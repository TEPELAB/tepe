excerpt: "This project develops a hybrid training program to support healthcare students develop necessary skills of serving underserved patients. This hybrid clinical training program consists of two phases, four weeks in class training in a game-based learning environment and two weeks onsite training at local underserved communities. Expected outcomes of this project include a hybrid clinical training program designed for healthcare students in SIU, publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations, stakeholder dissemination events (e.g., meetings, workshop), traditional information sharing items for local partners (e.g., fact sheets, technical reports, e-mail bulletins and newsletters), and new media connections with local partners (e.g., gamified applications for smartphones)."
