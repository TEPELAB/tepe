TEPE Lab conducts research in personalized education enhanced by novel technologies, such as gaming, analytic techniques, and machine learning techniques. If you are a student or researcher looking for senior projects, indenpendent study, or graduate study, feel free to contact me or talk to lab members. The following are projects currently conducting in the lab.

Personalized role-playing games in computer science education (PRPG-CS)
======
PRPG-CS project investigates how PRPG can support CS education by examing students' performance, flow experience, engagement patterns, learning motivation, and cultural differences.

Predicting organizatonal performance with machine learning (POP-ML)
======
POP-ML project explores factors that can predict organizaton retention, specifically employees' intention to leave by using machine learning techniques, including classification tree, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoosting. 

Preparing healthcare students serve underserved communities
======
This project develops a hybrid training program to support healthcare students develop necessary skills of serving underserved patients. This hybrid clinical training program consists of two phases, four weeks in class training in a game-based learning environment and two weeks onsite training at local underserved communities. Expected outcomes of this project include a hybrid clinical training program designed for healthcare students in SIU, publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations, stakeholder dissemination events (e.g., meetings, workshop), traditional information sharing items for local partners (e.g., fact sheets, technical reports, e-mail bulletins and newsletters), and new media connections with local partners (e.g., gamified applications for smartphones).
